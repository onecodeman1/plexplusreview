                    <p>Palermo is like a less charasmatic Berlin. (take that back, screw this nigga)</p>
                    <p>Marseille is getting up there for being a favorite character.</p>   
                    <p>I really liked this last part <i>A LOT</i> more than Part 3. Idk wtf they did to part 3 that made me dislike it so much. I guess I expected something better than Part 1 since it was so good. Maybe it didn't live up to hype I had in my head.</p>   
                    <p>Anyway, Nairobi died man. That really really sucked. She was one of those people that just needed to be on the team. It just feels empty without her. Kinda feel bad for Bogota </p>  
                    <p>BUT THAT LAST EPISODE THOUGH. I kinda guessed that the part where Gandia escaped was scripted by the profressor (because he said he killed Tokyo and I don't think they will do that). But I thought they were just going to let him go to the 
                      helicopter. Didn't think they'd steal the whole 'copter. That part was crazy. This dude Tamayo has gotten played so much its kinda hilarious. First that gps on the ferret scene and then the last episode lol.</p>  
                    <p>My favorite characters in no particular order: Marseille, Denver, Stockholm (lol that name), and Nairobi <br></p>
                     Denver because although he had his flaws like jealousy, overprotective-ness towards Stockholm,(but I get that) and being a straight up douche to Rio <i>at first</i>, he owned up to his mistakes and apologized to Rio and tried making that gold 
                     heart for Stockholm. </p>         
                    <p>Most hated characters: Arturo (Surprised?) and Palermo. I will never be able to forgive Palermoo because he indirectly killed Nairobi. Same with Tokyo
                      in Part 2 for indirectly killing Moscow. But I hate Palermo <i>a lot</i> more. I would put Gandia here but man was just crazy. He was just mad Tokyo and Nairobi made him look like a chump in the  Yeah I hate him but
                      idk, I guess you can say he was just doing his job.</p>

                      [10:50] Mad respect to this dude in charge. Don't remember his name, but mad respect. (Its Tamayo). He actually cares for his soldiers.

                      It took 3 episodes to actually get to the heist. Unlike P1 where it took like 1 episode.
                      Thank God Arturo hasn't made another appearance besides episode 1. I swear the writers were like "Lets REALLY piss off the watchers and make Arturo even more insufferable."
