                <p>I really really wished they had new intro music. It's a new hesit. The old music seemed like it belonged witht the last heist.</p>
                <p>Overall it seemed they increased the budget and lowered the quality of writing. 
                  For example, there was a point in the early episodes (don't remember which one) where the 5 bodyguards, of the governor, had the opportunity to 
                  immediately start shooting at Tokyo and Nairobi, but they didn't. They were going to blast them (like nothing like their moral code 
                  was going to stop them), but they stopped for god knows what reason.P1 and P2 didnt have that. They explained every move. Like ex. Berlin was sleeping on Adriana's lap and I was wondering why she didn't just 
                  kill him there. And low and behold, Berlin asks her why she doesnt't. We the audience, get that answer right away. There's no blatant plot armor.</p>
                <p>It had too many flashbacks. I kinda don't want more of Berlin. He was one of my favorite characters but if you want to kill a character off, <a class="font-italic">kill</a> him off.
                  P1/P2 had a perfect amount of flashbacks (of the profressor going through the plan). It just seemed like since people liked Berlin, they were like
                  "OK THEY LOVE BERLIN. WRITE HIM IN GO GO GO!"</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Also, I didn't like they soundtracks they chose. Never really seemed to fit the situation or was just the wrong song idk.</p>

                    <br></br>
                    [33:10] Was right about the increased budget, they using iPhones now lol
                    <br></br>
                    [33:52] Wtf was that nail bite off thing about?? They really just had her in one scene before, go to another scene, and bring her back to do that nail thing.
                    <br></br>
                    <i>Random Thoughts:</i>
                    It took 3 episodes to actually get to the heist. Unlike P1 where it took like 1 episode.
                    Thank God Arturo hasn't made another appearance besides episode 1. I swear the writers were like "Lets REALLY piss off the watchers and make Arturo even more insufferable."

                  <p>[25:41] Wtf was that dialogue between Berlin and Moscow. Like, I don't get it. Seemed weirdly forced.
                    I feel like that should've been in the last seasons.
                    <br></br>
                    [45:51] Eagle eye nigga got owned (Palermo)

                    <br></br>
                    [7:43] They say "...not even God would..." too loosely. Moscow said it in the last episode in the flashback. Ok we get it, you're
                    about to do some messed up shet.
                    <br></br>
                    [28:16] Finally, someone put Arturo in his place...HAH he's kinda like a hostage now but now of the police
                    <br></br>
                    [38:22] Kinda maybe sexist random realization. Did they make that negotion lady pregnant so she doesn't fall in love with the Profressor lol
                    <br></br>
                    [42:52ish] That's what I mean about the sound-track. I mean wtf is that. It seemed like it belongs in a Hallmark movie.
                    I kinda get what they're trying to do (making it look "oh Tokyo got her boyfriend back yipee"), but it's not that type of show.
                    <br></br>
                    [44:08] Wtf is with Rio doing that hand thing. I rather prefer he give a middle finger or something. Oh just realized he was doing that for the crowd

                  [11:35] Denver is starting to become my favorite character.
                  <br></br>
                  [27:32] LOL yo this scene was funny asl
                  <br></br>
                  FAVORITE Episode. Jeez that redeemed the season for me. I hope Nairobi doesn't die. She was my second favorite of the season.
