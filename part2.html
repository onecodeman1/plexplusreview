                  <p>Sooo they killed off 2 of my favorite characters TO BRING TOKYO BACK. And she annoyed me so how ironic was it that she literally came back and indirectly killed Moscow.</p>
                  <p>My top 3 favorite were Moscow, Nairobi, and Berlin (Berlin minus the sexist part). Moscow and Nairobi for kinda obvious reasons. Berlin because he had that no bs attitude. Yeah he tried to kill Monica but they were in a heist and she was trying to kill them or something. And he had that like charismatic  personality.</p>
                  <p>Berlin's name suited him very well becasuse at the end he was like the <i>Berlin Wall</i> hey ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>
                  <p>A little but of plot armor for Tokyo towards the end but I'll let it go because they actually killed of characters.</p>
                  <p>These brothers got so unlucky. Professor was sick as a child and Berlin as an adult.</p>
                  <p>Oh and kind of sad they didn’t like clip a piece of Arturo’s ear as a goodbye. THAT. DUDE. ANNOYING as hell.</p>
                  <p>Also, both Rio and Tokyo started to annoy me. Them separately and them together. Yeah I guess they needed to boost the show's rating and let them do their thang but GOD DAM were they just so childish. Only thing about Rio, he was young and immature. The professor even saw that. So I can let him slide. But Tokyo. It's hard for me to like her character. She didn't bring anything extra to the team besides annoying me.</p>
                  <p><i>Quick rundown of what I think about the characters I didn't mention:</i> Helsinki, cool guy. Teddy bear. Good solider. Overall good dude. Denver weirdly seemed the most neutral and normal guy there. At the end, I started to like his laugh.</p>
                  <p>Overall, I can’t believe how sexist some of the characters were. Like I wonder if they let this air on a "traditional" tv channel. how people in America would react.</p>
